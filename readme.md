# Custom login page Wordpress plugin

This plugin enables a custom page template that substitutes the standard Wordpress login url.

**How to use:** Activate the plugin, then add a page which will act as your new login page
and set its page template to *Custom login page* (it will appear in the page template dropdown
list in the *Page attributes* section of your Wordpress admin panel). The standard login url
(/wp-admin and /wp-login.php) will now become unavailable.

**Note:** This is an early version intended only for own/educational purposes.
