# Custom login page Wordpress plugin

This plugin enables a custom page template that substitutes the standard Wordpress login url.

**Important:** When plugin is enabled, you won't be able to log in with /wp-admin or /wp-login.php!
You need to add a page which will act as your new login page and set up its page template to *Custom login page*
(from the page template dropdown list in *Page attributes* section of your Wordpress admin panel).

**Note:** This is an early version intended only for own/educational purposes.
